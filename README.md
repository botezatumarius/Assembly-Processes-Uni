## 10 processes + pseudorandom number generator done in x86-64 assembly!
 Processes are as follows
<ul>
  <li>Concatenate two strings</li>
  <li>Convert a string to lower case</li>
  <li>Calculate the length of a string</li>
  <li>Invert a string</li>
  <li>Calculate square root of a number</li>
  <li>Calculate factorial of a number</li>
  <li>Calculate sum of prime n natural numbers</li>
  <li>Calculate sum of prime n odd numbers</li>
  <li>Remove an element from a list of numbers</li>
  <li>Remove spaces from a string</li>
</ul>
<br />
The number generator generates numbers between 1-56 and creates the same sequence of random numbers every time the program is run. To generate a new batch one must change the seed that is in the
eax register in the subroutine "process_0".
